## Developing

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and a single JS file is produced under build/static/js/main.{HASH}.js.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## Deploying

To deploy the application, just use a web server or a CDN to serve the single JS file that was built in the previous step.
